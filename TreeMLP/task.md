Act as an expert Machine Learning Engineer specializing in model benchmarking and MLOps. Your task is to generate a complete and well-structured Python Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file content.

**Objective:**
Create a benchmarking framework to evaluate a custom regression model architecture against standard machine learning models. The custom architecture uses the outputs (e.g., leaf indices or predictions) of a set of decision trees as additional input features for a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The benchmarking should be performed on datasets from the `OpenML-CTR23` suite available via the `openml` library, and all experiment runs, configurations, and results must be logged using `wandb`.

**Custom Model Architecture Details (to be implemented in the notebook):**
1.  **Input:** Takes standard input features `X`.
2.  **Stage 1: Decision Trees:** Train a collection (e.g., an ensemble like Random Forest or independently trained trees) of decision trees on `(X, y)`.
3.  **Stage 2: Feature Augmentation:** For a given input `X`, obtain outputs from the trained decision trees. These outputs could be:
    *   The leaf index each sample falls into for each tree (preferred, often requires one-hot encoding).
    *   The prediction made by each tree for each sample.
    *   *Initially, implement using leaf indices with one-hot encoding.*
4.  **Stage 3: MLP:** Concatenate the original features `X` with the augmented features derived from the decision trees. Feed this combined feature set into a standard MLP regressor for the final prediction.
5.  **Implementation:** Provide a placeholder class structure for this custom model, potentially inheriting from `sklearn.base.BaseEstimator` and `sklearn.base.RegressorMixin` for compatibility with scikit-learn pipelines and cross-validation. Clearly indicate where the core logic for training the trees, extracting features, and training the MLP needs to be filled in. Assume the MLP part can use scikit-learn's `MLPRegressor` or provide a basic structure if a deep learning library (like PyTorch/TensorFlow) is intended (though stick to scikit-learn components primarily for simplicity unless specified otherwise).

**Benchmarking Requirements:**
1.  **Dataset Suite:** Use the `OpenML-CTR23` suite from OpenML. Iterate through each dataset (task) in this suite. Handle potential errors during dataset loading or processing gracefully (e.g., skip problematic datasets and log a warning).
2.  **Comparison Models:** Benchmark the custom model against the following standard scikit-learn regressors:
    *   `LinearRegression`
    *   `Ridge`
    *   `Lasso`
    *   `SVR` (Support Vector Regression)
    *   `RandomForestRegressor`
    *   `GradientBoostingRegressor`
    *   `MLPRegressor` (as a baseline MLP without tree features)
3.  **Evaluation:**
    *   Use 5-fold cross-validation for evaluating each model on each dataset.
    *   Report standard regression metrics: R-squared (R²), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Use scikit-learn's scoring functions (e.g., `r2_score`, `neg_mean_absolute_error`, `neg_mean_squared_error`). Remember to handle the sign for minimization metrics.
4.  **Preprocessing:** Implement a standard preprocessing pipeline for each dataset within the cross-validation loop to prevent data leakage. This pipeline should include:
    *   Handling missing values (e.g., using `SimpleImputer`).
    *   Scaling numerical features (e.g., using `StandardScaler`).
    *   Encoding categorical features (e.g., using `OneHotEncoder`). Handle potential errors if categorical features are present.
5.  **WandB Integration:**
    *   Initialize a `wandb` project (e.g., "OpenML_Regression_Benchmark_2025").
    *   For *each combination* of dataset and model:
        *   Start a `wandb` run.
        *   Log the configuration: dataset name/ID, model name, model hyperparameters (use defaults initially, but structure for easy modification), CV folds, preprocessing steps.
        *   Log the evaluation metrics (R², MAE, RMSE) averaged across the CV folds as summary metrics for the run.
        *   *Optional but good:* Log metrics for each individual fold.
    *   Use `wandb.Table` to create a summary table comparing the average performance of all models across all datasets at the end of the notebook execution.

**Notebook Structure:**
1.  **Setup:** Import necessary libraries (`openml`, `sklearn`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `wandb`, etc.). Perform `wandb` login.
2.  **Configuration:** Define the OpenML suite ID, list of models to test, CV strategy, scoring metrics, `wandb` project name.
3.  **Custom Model Definition:** Define the placeholder class for the custom Decision Tree -> MLP model.
4.  **Helper Functions:** Define functions for preprocessing, model training/evaluation within a CV fold if needed.
5.  **Main Benchmarking Loop:**
    *   Get the list of tasks/datasets from the OpenML suite.
    *   Loop through each task ID:
        *   Download dataset using `openml.datasets.get_dataset`. Handle potential errors.
        *   Extract features `X` and target `y`. Identify categorical/numerical features.
        *   Define the preprocessing pipeline.
        *   Loop through each model (custom and standard):
            *   Initialize `wandb` run, logging configuration.
            *   Create the full `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` including preprocessing and the model.
            *   Perform cross-validation using `sklearn.model_selection.cross_validate`.
            *   Calculate average metrics across folds.
            *   Log average metrics to the current `wandb` run.
            *   Finish the `wandb` run.
        *   Store results locally (e.g., in a pandas DataFrame) for final summary.
6.  **Results Summary:**
    *   Display the collected results (e.g., the pandas DataFrame).
    *   Create and log a `wandb.Table` summarizing the performance across all models and datasets.

**Code Style and Best Practices:**
*   Use clear variable names.
*   Add comments explaining complex parts, especially the custom model structure and `wandb` logging steps.
*   Include error handling (e.g., `try-except` blocks for dataset loading and processing).
*   Ensure the notebook is runnable from top to bottom (assuming necessary libraries are installed and `wandb` is configured).
*   Clearly indicate the sections where the user needs to implement the specific logic for their custom model.
